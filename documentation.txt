Workflow 1: Training the Existing MobileNet Model
This workflow is about taking the existing MobileNet model, fine-tuning it with your dataset, and saving the trained model for later use.

High-Level Overview:
Preparing the Dataset:

File: prepareData.js
Code Overview:
Load and preprocess images from your dataset.
Organize images and labels into tensors (xs and ys).
Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
Return the datasets for training.
Fine-Tuning the MobileNet Model:

File: fineTuneModel.js
Code Overview:
Load the pre-trained MobileNet model.
Freeze the layers of the model that you don’t want to retrain.
Add custom layers on top of MobileNet to adapt it to your specific task.
Compile the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
Train the model using the prepared dataset.
Save the trained model to disk for later use.
Saving the Trained Model:

File: fineTuneModel.js
Code Overview:
Use TensorFlow.js functions like model.save('path_to_save_model') to save the trained model.
Workflow 2: User Uploading an Image, AI Analyzing It, and Giving Feedback
This workflow covers the entire user interaction process, from uploading an image to receiving AI-generated feedback.

High-Level Overview:
User Uploads an Image:

File: DesignAssistant.js
Code Overview:
Implement file upload functionality.
Capture and store the image data.
Trigger the design analysis process upon image upload.
Loading the Pre-Trained Model:

File: model/loading/ (could be a new script like loadModel.js)
Code Overview:
Load the pre-trained and fine-tuned MobileNet model from disk using tf.loadLayersModel('path_to_saved_model').
Ensure that the model is loaded only once and reused for subsequent analyses.
AI Analyzing the Image:

File: designAnalysis.js
Code Overview:
Preprocess the uploaded image to match the input format expected by the MobileNet model (resize, normalize, etc.).
Run the image through the loaded model using model.predict(tensor).
Collect and interpret the model’s output.
Generating Feedback:

File: openAIFeedback.js
Code Overview:
Take the output from the analysis (e.g., layout, color scheme, usability scores).
Generate feedback based on the analysis, possibly with a simple template or an OpenAI API call for more advanced feedback.
Return the feedback to be displayed to the user.
Displaying the Feedback:

File: DesignAssistant.js
Code Overview:
Display the generated feedback on the UI so the user can understand how their design was analyzed and what improvements are suggested.
Summary of Key Files and Their Roles:
prepareData.js: Prepares your dataset, including preprocessing images and splitting into training/validation sets.
fineTuneModel.js: Fine-tunes the MobileNet model with your dataset and saves the trained model.
DesignAssistant.js: Handles user interactions, like image uploads, and displays feedback.
model/loading/: Contains the logic to load the pre-trained and fine-tuned model.
designAnalysis.js: Uses the loaded model to analyze uploaded images.
openAIFeedback.js: Generates feedback based on the model’s analysis.
